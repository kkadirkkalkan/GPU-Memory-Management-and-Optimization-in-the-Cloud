# GPU Memory Management and Optimization in the Cloud

This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of GPU memory optimization techniques for Large Language Model (LLM) inference in cloud environments. The work is based on the paper **"Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention"**, with additional insights into modern methods like vLLM, Infinite-LLM, and HCache.

## Overview

The growing demands of Key-Value (KV) cache management in LLMs due to increasing context lengths have led to memory inefficiencies, particularly in GPU utilization. This repository focuses on:

1. **PagedAttention**:
   - A technique inspired by virtual memory systems, segmenting KV caches into smaller blocks to reduce memory fragmentation.
   - Supports dynamic memory allocation and sharing across GPU workers.

2. **vLLM**:
   - A serving engine that extends PagedAttention by introducing a centralized scheduler for distributed GPU workers.
   - Optimizes GPU memory utilization and batch processing for efficient LLM inference.

3. **Challenges & Innovations**:
   - Memory fragmentation, redundant duplication, and dynamic resource allocation inefficiencies.
   - Solutions like DistAttention (Infinite-LLM) and HCache to address scalability, latency, and cost issues in LLM services.
